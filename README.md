To solve this problem I use a backtracing algorithm. Backtracking is simply reverting back to the previous step or solution as soon as we determine that our current solution cannot be continued into a complete one. So it will cycle to each empty space and try a value, if the value is not valid in sudoku rules it will backtrack to the previous option and continue until the correct solution is filled.
